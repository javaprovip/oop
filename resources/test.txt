By gates of Eden, Angel, gentle,
Shone wi55th his softly drooped head,
And Demon, gloo345my and resentful34567
Over the hellish crevasse flapped.

The spirit of qualm and negation
Looked at an554other one – of good,
And fire of the forced elation
First time he va789guely understood.

“I’ve seen you,” he enunciated, -
“And not in vai6789n you’ve sent me light:
Not all in heaven I have hated,
Not all in world I have despised.”
